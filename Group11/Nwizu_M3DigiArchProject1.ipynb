    "The old Anchises bear, so from the waves of Tiber\n",
    "Did I the tired Caesar. And this man\n",
    "Is now become a god; and Cassius is\n",
    "A wretched creature, and must bend his body,\n",
    "If Caesar carelessly but nod on him.\n",
    "He had a fever when he was in Spain,\n",
    "And when the fit was on him I did mark\n",
    "How he did shake: ’tis true, this god did shake:\n",
    "His coward lips did from their colour fly,\n",
    "And that same eye whose bend doth awe the world\n",
    "Did lose his lustre. I did hear him groan:\n",
    "Ay, and that tongue of his, that bade the Romans\n",
    "Mark him, and write his speeches in their books,\n",
    "Alas, it cried, “Give me some drink, Titinius,”\n",
    "As a sick girl. Ye gods, it doth amaze me,\n",
    "A man of such a feeble temper should\n",
    "So get the start of the majestic world,\n",
    "And bear the palm alone.\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "BRUTUS.\n",
    "Another general shout?\n",
    "I do believe that these applauses are\n",
    "For some new honours that are heap’d on Caesar.\n",
    "\n",
    "CASSIUS.\n",
    "Why, man, he doth bestride the narrow world\n",
    "Like a Colossus, and we petty men\n",
    "Walk under his huge legs, and peep about\n",
    "To find ourselves dishonourable graves.\n",
    "Men at some time are masters of their fates:\n",
    "The fault, dear Brutus, is not in our stars,\n",
    "But in ourselves, that we are underlings.\n",
    "“Brutus” and “Caesar”: what should be in that “Caesar”?\n",
    "Why should that name be sounded more than yours?\n",
    "Write them together, yours is as fair a name;\n",
    "Sound them, it doth become the mouth as well;\n",
    "Weigh them, it is as heavy; conjure with ’em,\n",
    "“Brutus” will start a spirit as soon as “Caesar.”\n",
    "Now in the names of all the gods at once,\n",
    "Upon what meat doth this our Caesar feed,\n",
    "That he is grown so great? Age, thou art sham’d!\n",
    "Rome, thou hast lost the breed of noble bloods!\n",
    "When went there by an age since the great flood,\n",
    "But it was fam’d with more than with one man?\n",
    "When could they say, till now, that talk’d of Rome,\n",
    "That her wide walls encompass’d but one man?\n",
    "Now is it Rome indeed, and room enough,\n",
    "When there is in it but one only man.\n",
    "O, you and I have heard our fathers say,\n",

    "What you would work me to, I have some aim:\n",
    "How I have thought of this, and of these times,\n",
    "I shall recount hereafter. For this present,\n",
    "I would not, so with love I might entreat you,\n",
    "Be any further mov’d. What you have said,\n",
    "I will consider; what you have to say\n",
    "I will with patience hear; and find a time\n",
    "Both meet to hear and answer such high things.\n",
    "Till then, my noble friend, chew upon this:\n",
    "Brutus had rather be a villager\n",
    "Than to repute himself a son of Rome\n",
    "Under these hard conditions as this time\n",
    "Is like to lay upon us.\n",

    "What hath proceeded worthy note today.\n",
    "\n",
    "BRUTUS.\n",
    "I will do so. But, look you, Cassius,\n",
    "The angry spot doth glow on Caesar’s brow,\n",
    "And all the rest look like a chidden train:\n",
    "Calphurnia’s cheek is pale; and Cicero\n",
    "Looks with such ferret and such fiery eyes\n",
    "As we have seen him in the Capitol,\n",
    "Being cross’d in conference by some senators.\n",
    "\n",
    "CASSIUS.\n",

    "So soon as that spare Cassius. He reads much,\n",
    "He is a great observer, and he looks\n",
    "Quite through the deeds of men. He loves no plays,\n",
    "As thou dost, Antony; he hears no music.\n",
    "Seldom he smiles; and smiles in such a sort\n",
    "As if he mock’d himself and scorn’d his spirit\n",
    "That could be mov’d to smile at anything.\n",
    "Such men as he be never at heart’s ease\n",
    "Whiles they behold a greater than themselves,\n",

    "BRUTUS.\n",
    "I should not then ask Casca what had chanc’d.\n",
    "\n",
    "CASCA.\n",
    "Why, there was a crown offer’d him; and being offer’d him, he put it by\n",
    "with the back of his hand, thus; and then the people fell a-shouting.\n",
    "\n",
    "BRUTUS.\n",
    "What was the second noise for?\n",
    "\n",
    "CASCA.\n",
    "Why, for that too.\n",
    "\n",
    "CASSIUS.\n",
    "They shouted thrice: what was the last cry for?\n",
    "\n",
    "CASCA.\n",
    "Why, for that too.\n",
    "\n",
    "BRUTUS.\n",
    "Was the crown offer’d him thrice?\n",
    "\n",
    "CASCA.\n",
    "Ay, marry, was’t, and he put it by thrice, every time gentler than\n",
    "other; and at every putting-by mine honest neighbours shouted.\n",
    "\n",
    "CASSIUS.\n",
    "Who offer’d him the crown?\n",
    "\n",
    "CASCA.\n",
    "Why, Antony.\n",
    "\n",
    "BRUTUS.\n",
    "Tell us the manner of it, gentle Casca.\n",
    "\n",
    "CASCA.\n",
    "I can as well be hang’d, as tell the manner of it: it was mere foolery;\n",
    "I did not mark it. I saw Mark Antony offer him a crown; yet ’twas not a\n",
    "crown neither, ’twas one of these coronets; and, as I told you, he put\n",
    "it by once: but, for all that, to my thinking, he would fain have had\n",
    "it. Then he offered it to him again: then he put it by again: but, to\n",
    "my thinking, he was very loath to lay his fingers off it. And then he\n",
    "offered it the third time; he put it the third time by; and still, as\n",
    "he refus’d it, the rabblement hooted, and clapp’d their chopt hands,\n",
    "and threw up their sweaty night-caps, and uttered such a deal of\n",
    "stinking breath because Caesar refus’d the crown, that it had, almost,\n",
    "choked Caesar, for he swooned, and fell down at it. And for mine own\n",
    "part, I durst not laugh, for fear of opening my lips and receiving the\n",
    "bad air.\n",
    "\n",
    "CASSIUS.\n",
    "But, soft! I pray you. What, did Caesar swoon?\n",
    "\n",
    "CASCA.\n",
    "He fell down in the market-place, and foam’d at mouth, and was\n",
    "speechless.\n",
    "\n",
    "BRUTUS.\n",
    "’Tis very like: he hath the falling-sickness.\n",
    "\n",
    "CASSIUS.\n",
    "No, Caesar hath it not; but you, and I,\n",
    "And honest Casca, we have the falling-sickness.\n",
    "\n",
    "CASCA.\n",
    "I know not what you mean by that; but I am sure Caesar fell down. If\n",
    "the tag-rag people did not clap him and hiss him, according as he\n",
    "pleased and displeased them, as they use to do the players in the\n",
    "theatre, I am no true man.\n",
    "\n",
    "BRUTUS.\n",
    "What said he when he came unto himself?\n",
    "\n",
    "CASCA.\n",
    "Marry, before he fell down, when he perceived the common herd was glad\n",
    "he refused the crown, he pluck’d me ope his doublet, and offer’d them\n",
    "his throat to cut. And I had been a man of any occupation, if I would\n",
    "not have taken him at a word, I would I might go to hell among the\n",
    "rogues. And so he fell. When he came to himself again, he said, if he\n",
    "had done or said anything amiss, he desir’d their worships to think it\n",
    "was his infirmity. Three or four wenches where I stood cried, “Alas,\n",
    "good soul!” and forgave him with all their hearts. But there’s no heed\n",
    "to be taken of them: if Caesar had stabb’d their mothers, they would\n",
    "have done no less.\n",
    "\n",
    "BRUTUS.\n",
    "And, after that, he came thus sad away?\n",
    "\n",
    "CASCA.\n",
    "Ay.\n",
    "\n",
    "CASSIUS.\n",
    "Did Cicero say anything?\n",
    "\n",
    "CASCA.\n",
    "Ay, he spoke Greek.\n",
    "\n",
    "CASSIUS.\n",
    "To what effect?\n",
    "\n",
    "CASCA.\n",
    "Nay, and I tell you that, I’ll ne’er look you i’ the face again. But\n",
    "those that understood him smil’d at one another and shook their heads;\n",
    "but for mine own part, it was Greek to me. I could tell you more news\n",
    "too: Marullus and Flavius, for pulling scarfs off Caesar’s images, are\n",
    "put to silence. Fare you well. There was more foolery yet, if I could\n",
    "remember it.\n",
    "\n",
    "CASSIUS.\n",

    "Ay, if I be alive, and your mind hold, and your dinner worth the\n",
    "eating.\n",
    "\n",
    "CASSIUS.\n",
    "Good. I will expect you.\n",

    "CASSIUS.\n",
    "So is he now in execution\n",
    "Of any bold or noble enterprise,\n",
    "However he puts on this tardy form.\n",
    "This rudeness is a sauce to his good wit,\n",
    "Which gives men stomach to digest his words\n",
    "With better appetite.\n",
    "\n",
    "BRUTUS.\n",
    "And so it is. For this time I will leave you:\n",

    "If I were Brutus now, and he were Cassius,\n",
    "He should not humour me. I will this night,\n",
    "In several hands, in at his windows throw,\n",
    "As if they came from several citizens,\n",
    "Writings, all tending to the great opinion\n",
    "That Rome holds of his name; wherein obscurely\n",

    "Why are you breathless, and why stare you so?\n",
    "\n",
    "CASCA.\n",
    "Are not you moved, when all the sway of earth\n",
    "Shakes like a thing unfirm? O Cicero,\n",
    "I have seen tempests, when the scolding winds\n",
    "Have riv’d the knotty oaks; and I have seen\n",
    "Th’ ambitious ocean swell and rage and foam,\n",
    "To be exalted with the threatening clouds:\n",
    "But never till tonight, never till now,\n",
    "Did I go through a tempest dropping fire.\n",
    "Either there is a civil strife in heaven,\n",

    "Why, saw you anything more wonderful?\n",
    "\n",
    "CASCA.\n",
    "A common slave, you’d know him well by sight,\n",
    "Held up his left hand, which did flame and burn\n",
    "Like twenty torches join’d, and yet his hand,\n",
    "Not sensible of fire remain’d unscorch’d.\n",
    "Besides, I ha’ not since put up my sword,\n",
    "Against the Capitol I met a lion,\n",
    "Who glared upon me, and went surly by,\n",
    "Without annoying me. And there were drawn\n",
    "Upon a heap a hundred ghastly women,\n",
    "Transformed with their fear; who swore they saw\n",
    "Men, all in fire, walk up and down the streets.\n",
    "And yesterday the bird of night did sit,\n",
    "Even at noonday upon the marketplace,\n",
    "Hooting and shrieking. When these prodigies\n",
    "Do so conjointly meet, let not men say,\n",

    "Who ever knew the heavens menace so?\n",
    "\n",
    "CASSIUS.\n",
    "Those that have known the earth so full of faults.\n",
    "For my part, I have walk’d about the streets,\n",
    "Submitting me unto the perilous night;\n",
    "And, thus unbraced, Casca, as you see,\n",
    "Have bar’d my bosom to the thunder-stone;\n",
    "And when the cross blue lightning seem’d to open\n",
    "The breast of heaven, I did present myself\n",
    "Even in the aim and very flash of it.\n",
    "\n",
    "CASCA.\n",
    "But wherefore did you so much tempt the Heavens?\n",
    "It is the part of men to fear and tremble,\n",

    "\n",
    "CASSIUS.\n",
    "You are dull, Casca; and those sparks of life\n",
    "That should be in a Roman you do want,\n",
    "Or else you use not. You look pale and gaze,\n",
    "And put on fear and cast yourself in wonder,\n",
    "To see the strange impatience of the Heavens:\n",
    "But if you would consider the true cause\n",
    "Why all these fires, why all these gliding ghosts,\n",
    "Why birds and beasts, from quality and kind;\n",
    "Why old men, fools, and children calculate,\n",
    "Why all these things change from their ordinance,\n",
    "Their natures, and pre-formed faculties,\n",
    "To monstrous quality; why, you shall find\n",
    "That Heaven hath infus’d them with these spirits,\n",
    "To make them instruments of fear and warning\n",
    "Unto some monstrous state.\n",
    "Now could I, Casca, name to thee a man\n",
    "Most like this dreadful night,\n",
    "That thunders, lightens, opens graves, and roars,\n",
    "As doth the lion in the Capitol;\n",
    "A man no mightier than thyself, or me,\n",
    "In personal action; yet prodigious grown,\n",
    "And fearful, as these strange eruptions are.\n",

    "\n",
    "CASSIUS.\n",
    "Let it be who it is: for Romans now\n",
    "Have thews and limbs like to their ancestors;\n",

    "And we are govern’d with our mothers’ spirits;\n",
    "Our yoke and sufferance show us womanish.\n",
    "\n",
    "CASCA.\n",
    "Indeed, they say the senators tomorrow\n",
    "Mean to establish Caesar as a king;\n",
    "And he shall wear his crown by sea and land,\n",
    "In every place, save here in Italy.\n",
    "\n",
    "CASSIUS.\n",
    "I know where I will wear this dagger then;\n",

    "Therein, ye gods, you tyrants do defeat.\n",
    "Nor stony tower, nor walls of beaten brass,\n",
    "Nor airless dungeon, nor strong links of iron,\n",
    "Can be retentive to the strength of spirit;\n",
    "But life, being weary of these worldly bars,\n",
    "Never lacks power to dismiss itself.\n",
    "If I know this, know all the world besides,\n",
    "That part of tyranny that I do bear\n",
    "I can shake off at pleasure.\n",
    "\n",
    "[_Thunder still._]\n",
    "\n",
    "CASCA.\n",
    "So can I:\n",
    "So every bondman in his own hand bears\n",
    "The power to cancel his captivity.\n",
    "\n",
    "CASSIUS.\n",
    "And why should Caesar be a tyrant then?\n",
    "Poor man! I know he would not be a wolf,\n",
    "But that he sees the Romans are but sheep:\n",
    "He were no lion, were not Romans hinds.\n",
    "Those that with haste will make a mighty fire\n",
    "Begin it with weak straws. What trash is Rome,\n",
    "What rubbish, and what offal, when it serves\n",
    "For the base matter to illuminate\n",
    "So vile a thing as Caesar! But, O grief,\n",
    "Where hast thou led me? I, perhaps, speak this\n",
    "Before a willing bondman: then I know\n",
    "My answer must be made; but I am arm’d,\n",
    "And dangers are to me indifferent.\n",
    "\n",
    "CASCA.\n",
    "You speak to Casca, and to such a man\n",
    "That is no fleering tell-tale. Hold, my hand:\n",
    "Be factious for redress of all these griefs,\n",
    "And I will set this foot of mine as far\n",
    "As who goes farthest.\n",
    "\n",
    "CASSIUS.\n",
    "There’s a bargain made.\n",
    "Now know you, Casca, I have mov’d already\n",
    "Some certain of the noblest-minded Romans\n",
    "To undergo with me an enterprise\n",
    "Of honourable-dangerous consequence;\n",
    "And I do know by this, they stay for me\n",
    "In Pompey’s Porch: for now, this fearful night,\n",
    "There is no stir or walking in the streets;\n",
    "And the complexion of the element\n",
    "In favour’s like the work we have in hand,\n",
    "Most bloody, fiery, and most terrible.\n",
    "\n",
    "Enter Cinna.\n",

    "\n",
    "TREBONIUS.\n",

    "CASSIUS.\n",
    "But it is doubtful yet\n",

    "Of fantasy, of dreams, and ceremonies.\n",
    "It may be these apparent prodigies,\n",
    "The unaccustom’d terror of this night,\n",

    "\n",
    "DECIUS.\n",
    "Never fear that: if he be so resolved,\n",
    "I can o’ersway him, for he loves to hear\n",
    "That unicorns may be betray’d with trees,\n",
    "And bears with glasses, elephants with holes,\n",
    "Lions with toils, and men with flatterers.\n",
    "But when I tell him he hates flatterers,\n",
    "He says he does, being then most flattered.\n",

    "Nor for yours neither. Y’ have ungently, Brutus,\n",
    "Stole from my bed; and yesternight at supper,\n",
    "You suddenly arose, and walk’d about,\n",
    "Musing and sighing, with your arms across;\n",
    "And when I ask’d you what the matter was,\n",
    "You star’d upon me with ungentle looks.\n",
    "I urg’d you further; then you scratch’d your head,\n",
    "And too impatiently stamp’d with your foot;\n",
    "Yet I insisted, yet you answer’d not,\n",
    "But with an angry wafture of your hand\n",
    "Gave sign for me to leave you. So I did,\n",
    "Fearing to strengthen that impatience\n",
    "Which seem’d too much enkindled; and withal\n",
    "Hoping it was but an effect of humour,\n",
    "Which sometime hath his hour with every man.\n",
    "It will not let you eat, nor talk, nor sleep;\n",
    "And could it work so much upon your shape\n",

    "To walk unbraced and suck up the humours\n",
    "Of the dank morning? What, is Brutus sick,\n",

    "To dare the vile contagion of the night,\n",
    "And tempt the rheumy and unpurged air\n",
    "To add unto his sickness? No, my Brutus;\n",
    "You have some sick offence within your mind,\n",

    "I ought to know of: and, upon my knees,\n",
    "I charm you, by my once commended beauty,\n",
    "By all your vows of love, and that great vow\n",

    "That you unfold to me, your self, your half,\n",
    "Why you are heavy, and what men tonight\n",

    "That appertain to you? Am I your self\n",
    "But, as it were, in sort or limitation,\n",
    "To keep with you at meals, comfort your bed,\n",

    "Tell us the manner of it, gentle Casca.\n",
    "\n",
    "CASCA.\n",
    "I can as well be hang’d, as tell the manner of it: it was mere foolery;\n",
    "I did not mark it. I saw Mark Antony offer him a crown; yet ’twas not a\n",
    "crown neither, ’twas one of these coronets; and, as I told you, he put\n",
    "it by once: but, for all that, to my thinking, he would fain have had\n",
    "it. Then he offered it to him again: then he put it by again: but, to\n",
    "my thinking, he was very loath to lay his fingers off it. And then he\n",
    "offered it the third time; he put it the third time by; and still, as\n",
    "he refus’d it, the rabblement hooted, and clapp’d their chopt hands,\n",
    "and threw up their sweaty night-caps, and uttered such a deal of\n",
    "stinking breath because Caesar refus’d the crown, that it had, almost,\n",
    "choked Caesar, for he swooned, and fell down at it. And for mine own\n",
    "part, I durst not laugh, for fear of opening my lips and receiving the\n",
    "bad air.\n",
    "\n",
    "CASSIUS.\n",
    "But, soft! I pray you. What, did Caesar swoon?\n",
    "\n",
    "CASCA.\n",
    "He fell down in the market-place, and foam’d at mouth, and was\n",
    "speechless.\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "CASCA.\n",
    "I know not what you mean by that; but I am sure Caesar fell down. If\n",
    "the tag-rag people did not clap him and hiss him, according as he\n",
    "pleased and displeased them, as they use to do the players in the\n",
    "theatre, I am no true man.\n",
    "\n",
    "BRUTUS.\n",
    "What said he when he came unto himself?\n",
    "\n",
    "CASCA.\n",
    "Marry, before he fell down, when he perceived the common herd was glad\n",
    "he refused the crown, he pluck’d me ope his doublet, and offer’d them\n",
    "his throat to cut. And I had been a man of any occupation, if I would\n",
    "not have taken him at a word, I would I might go to hell among the\n",
    "rogues. And so he fell. When he came to himself again, he said, if he\n",
    "had done or said anything amiss, he desir’d their worships to think it\n",
    "was his infirmity. Three or four wenches where I stood cried, “Alas,\n",
    "good soul!” and forgave him with all their hearts. But there’s no heed\n",

    "have done no less.\n",
    "\n",
    "BRUTUS.\n",

    "Did Cicero say anything?\n",

    "Nay, and I tell you that, I’ll ne’er look you i’ the face again. But\n",
    "those that understood him smil’d at one another and shook their heads;\n",

    "# Analysis\n",
    "The aim of this analysis is to establish the sentiment invoked by the mention of the names, BRUTUS and CAESAR in the supplied text sample in the code. To also show how the narratives in the tone of the characters changes before and after any of the character's name is mentioned. This helps us to get an insight on how their tones affect the entirety of the story plot.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Sequence Changes\n",
    "In analyzing the sequential changes in the segments of text before or after any of the character's name is mentioned, we can be able to observe how sentiments change with time in the context of the speaker's emotional tone.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Text Selection and Reasoning\n",
    "The reason this text portraying the dialogue between Caesar and Brutus was selected is due to its relevance to key moments referencing the characters of Caesar and Brutus. The text allows for a proper analysis of the interaction between the two characters, shedding light on their emotional states.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Intermediate Results\n",
    "**BRUTUS**\n",
    "\n",
    "Segment 1: The sentiment changes from neutral to negative, indicating the way he perceives the conversation.<br>\n",
    "Segment 2: The segment highlights a change in tone from negative to positive, suggesting willingness to resolve any misunderstanding.<br>\n",
    "Segment 3: This segment shows a positive shift in sentiment.<br>\n",
    "Segment 4: This segment shows a change in pattern from positive to negative indicating some sort of conflict.<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "**CAESAR**: The data shows a similar transition in sentiment to that of Brutus\n",
    "\n",
    "## Final Analysis, Summary and Reflection\n",
    "The sentiment analysis showcases the complex emotional scene of the dialogue between Caesar and Brutus. Brutus was depicted as a complex character whose emotion works like a swinging pendulum that swings more towards the left-side, indicating a character with tendency towards a negative disposition. A character who was faced with the dilemma of persoanal ambition and loyalty.\n",
    "\n",
    "The analysis of Caesar suggests a similar narrative to that of Brutus. The evolution of these sentiment underlines the scene's display of leadership and downfall. The sentiment analysis focuses on the portrayal of the characters of Caesar and Brutus and the evolution of their respective emotional states from one segment to the other, thereby giving an insight of their emotional status at each point in time.\n",
